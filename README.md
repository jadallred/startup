# startup
my first repository for my start up application

Change from developement environment

changes from Github

changes from vsCode

I have learned from this assignment how to work on Github and also vsCode and how to pull and push from one to the other. How to solve merging issues and the ways to help so your work doesn't get ruined in one place and the benefits of multiple development environments.

Elevator Pitch:

Have you ever wanted to connect with your coworkers in an easy and fun way? This game application makes it so you can log onto the game and all compete for the highest score. The game is called swimming seahorse and you use the space bar key to swim between seaweed. If you get hit then the game is over and your score is displayed next to everyone else who played the game.

now my website is secure! This is because of going through Caddy and such. 

Using HTML it is responsible for the basic layout but the design and style comes from CSS. 

From working on the simon project already i've been able to learn and understand more about HTML. Its confusing but as I was writing the code I realized its a little repetitive. 

worked on the simon CSS file and was able to see how they go individually into each button and help set it up.
